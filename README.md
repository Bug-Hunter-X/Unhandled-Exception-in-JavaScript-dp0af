This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unhandled exceptions. The `divide` function throws an error if the second argument is 0, but the code does not handle this error. This can cause the program to crash.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file contains the solution, which uses a `try...catch` statement to handle the exception.
